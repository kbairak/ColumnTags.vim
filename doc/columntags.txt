*ColumnTags*	Plugin for following tags in column-view
                                                                       
This plugin offers commands and mappings to better navigate tags revealing both
the calling code and the definitions.

Commands:

:CollumnTagOpen                                         *:CollumnTagOpen*
CTRL_]                      Follow the tag under the cursor in a new vertical
                            split. If the number of existing columns is
                            g:max_columns and the rightmost column is focused,
                            the view will be shifted to the left before doing
                            the vertical split. If you follow a tag from a
                            column that is not rightmost, the new column will
                            replace those that are to the right of the one that
                            was in focus.

:CollumnTagClose                                        *:CollumnTagClose*
CTRL_t                      Go back to where you were before following a tag.
                            If the column under focus is not the leftmost, this
                            means simply focusing on the column to the left. If
                            the leftmost column was focused, the windows that
                            got hidden by following tags and moving towards the
                            right will start being revealed.

:CollumnTagShiftLeft                                    *:CollumnTagShiftLeft*
CTRL_,                      Shift all you columns to the left, revealing
                            columns that got hidden as your were navigating
                            tags to ther right, without changing the focused
                            window.
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                        *ColumnTags-settings*
